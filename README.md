# FSSP_CA
This project is a graphical simulator for the classic computer science problem, the **Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP)**, implemented in Python. It provides a robust and user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze the behavior of cellular automata designed to solve this synchronization challenge.
